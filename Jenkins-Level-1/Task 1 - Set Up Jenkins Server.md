# Task 1: Set Up Jenkins Server

## Question

The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:

**Task:**

1. Install `Jenkins` on the jenkins server using the `yum` utility only, and start its service.

  - If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, refer to [this](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/systemd-services/#starting-services).

2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `Kirsty` and email should be `kirsty@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

`Note:` 

1. To access the `jenkins` server, connect from the jump host using the `root` user with the password `S3curePass`.

2. After Jenkins server installation, click the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI and follow on-screen instructions to create an admin user.

java -version
```

3. **Add Jenkins Repository**

Use yum to add the official Jenkins repo:

```bash
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
```

4. **Install Jenkins**

```bash
sudo yum install -y jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

5. **Enable and Start Jenkins**

```bash
systemctl enable jenkins
systemctl start jenkins
```
Check status:

```bash
systemctl status jenkins
```

6. **Access Jenkins UI**

Open your browser and navigate to:

```bash
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
Copy that password and paste it into the browser.
