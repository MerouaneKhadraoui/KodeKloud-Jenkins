# Task 3: Configure Jenkins User Access

## Question

The Nautilus team is integrating Jenkins into their CI/CD pipelines. After setting up a new Jenkins server, they're now configuring user access for the development team, Follow these steps:

**Task:**

1. Click on the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login with username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.

2. Create a jenkins user named `rose` with the password `8FmzjvFU6S`. Their full name should match `Rose`.

3. Utilize the `Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy` to assign `overall read` permission to the `rose` user.

4. Remove all permissions for `Anonymous` users (if any) ensuring that the `admin` user retains overall `Administer` permissions.

5. For the existing job, grant `rose` user only `read` permissions, disregarding other permissions such as Agent, SCM etc.

`Note:` 

1. You may need to install plugins and restart Jenkins service. After plugins installation, select `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on plugin installation/update page.

2. After restarting the Jenkins service, wait for the Jenkins login page to reappear before proceeding. Avoid clicking `Finish` immediately after restarting the service.

3. Capture screenshots of your configuration for review purposes. Consider using screen recording software like `loom.com` for documentation and sharing.
